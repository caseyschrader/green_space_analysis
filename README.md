# green_space_analysis

A script to analyze the greenspace accessability for Salt Lake City (the script can be modified for any city by changing the bbox values).

It first calculates straight line distances with a visualization and does the same for network distances (path to the park via streets rather than flying/walking through buildings).

The current analysis area is quite small as the network distance analysis takes some time to process. This analysis is for a few blocks within the central city neighborhood and calculates for roughly 850 buildings.
